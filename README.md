# BridgeSense | A Structural Integrity Forecast Engine

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

*This project's goal is to predict if a bridge next year will receive a 'Poor' condition rating, using available NBI features like traffic, environmental factors, and material type. Given that a poor rating indicates serious problems that may lead to failure, this prediction provides critical insight that can be used proactively to take active measures and avoid collapse, rather than waiting for the scheduled times where bridges are inspected.*

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases*
   - *Inspection Frequency Bias: Depending on how often bridges were inspected due to various factors such as location and economics, results may skew toward bridges that get inspected more often. *
   - *Geographic Bias: There will be some unpredictable factors that alter the result, which decreases the validity of the study.*
   - *Algorithmic Bias: It may ignore outliers, misjudge whether or not it is a linear relationship,  and may ignore multiple factors that influence the outcome. *


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
